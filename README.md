A robotic arm is a type of mechanical arm, usually programmable, with similar functions to a human
arm; the arm may be the sum total of the mechanism or may be part of a more complex robot. The
links of such a manipulator are connected by joints allowing either rotational motion (such as in an
articulated robot) or translational (linear) displacement.The links of the manipulator can be
considered to form a kinematic chain. The terminus of the kinematic chain of the manipulator is
called the end effector and it is analogous to the human hand. A robotic arm can be used for varied
applications such as assembly operations, workpiece handling, pick and place, application of
sealant, spot welding operation etc. This paper mainly talks about a pick and place robotic arm.
Pick and place robotic arm picks a particular object from a given position and drops it to another
position from where the work further takes place.Pick and place robots are commonly used in
modern manufacturing environments.Pick and place robots handle repetitive tasks while freeing up
human workers to focus on more complex work.Automating this process helps to increase
production rates.

Pick and place robots are not only used in manufacturing but are also used in other applications
some of which are listed below:

● Assembly – Pick and place robots used in assembly applications grab incoming parts
from one location, such as a conveyor, and place or affix the part on another piece of the
item. The two joined parts are then transported to the next assembly area.

● Packaging – Pick and place robots used in the packaging process grab items from an
incoming source or designated area and place the items in a packaging container.

● Bin picking – Pick and place robots used in bin picking applications grab parts or items
from bins. These pick and place robots typically have advanced vision systems allowing
them to distinguish colour, shape and size to pick the right items even from bins
containing randomly mixed items. These parts or items are then sent to another location
for assembly or packaging.

● Inspection – Pick and place robots used for inspection applications are equipped with
advanced vision systems to pick up objects, detect anomalies and remove defective
parts or items by placing them in a designated location.

This project includes the design and simulation of a 2R link manipulator using computer
programming i.e, how the link dimension will vary because of change in payload and how both the
links will move when they are given a task of moving from one coordinate to the other for pick and
place operation.
